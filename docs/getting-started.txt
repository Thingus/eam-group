Resources for students and postdocs starting in the Marais Research Group at University of Leicester (UoL). 

This document is preliminary and still under development. 

The Marais Research group is part of the Earth Observations Sciences (EOS) research group in Physics and Astronomy at
University of Leicester. Group activities include presenting and attending exclusive research group meetings and 
group meetings with the other EOS research groups.

GEOS-Chem model website: http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/geos/index.html

The GitHub /eam-group/doc/ directory also inclues .bashrc and .my_personal_settings files that you can use to customize
your ALICE/SPECTRE environment and set up aliases of commonly used commands. 

The GitHub /eam-group/doc/ directory also includes samples of GEOS-Chem submit and run scripts for the Leicester HPC.
These are specific to version 12.1.0 of the model. Consult the GEOS-Chem user manual to update compile switches to the
version you're using. The version of the model you're using may also require more resources than are specified in the submit
script. To determine this, conduct test simulations on the development queue before submitting the job.

EOS Group Resources and Information:
======================================
There is an EOS email list. Check with Bev Robinson that you have been added to this to get updates on group meetings and
any details on group activities.

EOS wiki (internal) with EOS group seminar series schedule: https://wiki.lamp.le.ac.uk/eos/index.php/Seminars
If you can't access the wiki with your UoL login, ask Robert Parker to give you access.

The wiki also includes ... https://wiki.lamp.le.ac.uk/eos/index.php/IT

The EOS seminar organizer is Neil Humpage. If you'd like to invite someone to present at the seminar series (virtually
during the lockdown), contact Neil with details of the person you'd like to invite.

EOS group meetings occur monthly or biweekly depending on the time of year. These can also occur with the Centre 
for Landscape and Climate Research (CLCR; https://www2.le.ac.uk/colleges/scieng/research/centres/clcr). EOS only and 
EOS-CLCR seminars are on Fridays at 10-11:30am and typically include 2 speakers. Kamil Mroz, postdoc in EOS, organizes 
these and sends calendar invites of upcoming talks to the EOS mailing list. 

Duncan Ross is Health and Safetly Officer. After the lockdown, when we're permitted to be back on campus, schedule a 
health and safety training session with him. This includes rules to follow when accessing the building after hours.
